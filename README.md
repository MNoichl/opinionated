# Opinionated

`opinionated` provides simple, clean stylesheets for plotting with `matplotlib`. 
It's modelled and named after hrbrthemes in R, by hrbrmstr, which are "Opinionated, typographic-centric ggplot2 themes", although I have made some different choices. 

The main application I had in mind was to increase the quality of plots in colab-environments, where there is a very small range of preinstalled fonts. The package therefore automatically downloads fonts from GoogleFonts. But I think everything should also work on your local machine.
